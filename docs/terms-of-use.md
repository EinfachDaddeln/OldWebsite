## Privacy policy

No identifiable data is shared with third parties, unless such data transfer is initiated by the user.

Some services require the use of first-party cookies and/or local storage, which are required to provide the service (such as remembering user preferences) and are not collected by anyone. None of the services employ third-party cookies.

## Abuse protection

The service uses bot, hacking and DDoS protections which, upon detection of abusive behavior, will temporarly collect the IP-address, timestamp, request-url and user-agent of a visitor for the purpose of protecting the service against further abusive behavior.

The data collected by the abuse protection will not be shared with any third parties and will be deleted automatically after 7 days.

Normal usage of the service will not trigger this data collection.

Repeated abusive behavior will result in several restrictions, ranging from rate-limiting to temporary firewall-level lockout.

These services act as proxies (aka. "frontends") for their corresponding platforms.
The services are hosted in the European Union, so the European Union's laws apply to it.

Under the directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, "temporary acts of reproduction [...], which are transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable: a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary" is allowed, and legal.

As such, takedown requests regarding content on these services should be sent to the proxied platforms (for example Google).

Any takedown requests that are addressed to us will be ignored.

Repeated attempts are considered abuse and will result in legal consequences. The maintainer of this service will not be intimidated and is prepared to defend the service in the European court, if neccessary.

The terms of the service may change at any time without notice.
