# The current status of Invidious

As many of you have noticed, the Invidious instance has stopped working and displays "This helps protect our community. Learn more" when opening a video.

This is due to YouTube rolling out changes which affect some instances, we are awaiting for a update from the Invidious mainteners to fix this issue. 

Until then the instance is broken, and we can't really change it.

P.S: We are working on routing Invidious traffic through a few residential ips that we have access to which should help the instance not get flagged by YouTube, but that is still in the works.
