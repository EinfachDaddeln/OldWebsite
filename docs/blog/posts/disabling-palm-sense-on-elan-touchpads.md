# Disabling Palm Sense on Elan Touchpads

I own a Laptop with a Elan Touchpad (which sucks) and since using the Touchpad while typing is not possible i looked through a few forums and found some registry entries to change.


Just download the File and apply it, and restart. After that you should be able to type and use the Touchpad at the same time.
